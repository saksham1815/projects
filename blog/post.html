        <h2>Building a Speech-to-Text Application with Voice Modulation</h2>
        <p>
          Creating a speech-to-text application with voice modulation
          capabilities is an exciting project that leverages several modern web
          technologies. In this blog post, we'll explore the APIs and libraries
          used to build such an application, highlighting their features and how
          they contribute to the functionality of the app.
        </p>
        <h3>APIs and Libraries Used</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Speech API</li>
          <li>Speech Synthesis API</li>
          <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1. Web Speech API</h4>
        <p>
          The Web Speech API provides powerful tools for speech recognition and
          synthesis. This API is a crucial component of our application,
          enabling it to transcribe spoken words into text...
        </p>
        <h4>2. Speech Synthesis API</h4>
        <p>
          The Speech Synthesis API enables the application to convert text into
          spoken words. This API provides functionality for adjusting voice
          parameters such as pitch and rate, and for selecting different
          voices...
        </p>
        <h4>3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h4>
        <p>
          While the Web Speech API and Speech Synthesis API handle the core
          functionalities of speech recognition and synthesis, HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript are used to create and style the user interface, and to
          manage the overall application logic...
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          By utilizing the Web Speech API and Speech Synthesis API, along with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we've created a robust speech-to-text
          application with voice modulation capabilities. These APIs provide
          powerful tools for handling speech recognition and synthesis, while
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript enable us to build a user-friendly and
          visually appealing interface...
